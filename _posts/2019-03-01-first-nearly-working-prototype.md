## First nearly working prototype

###### February 2019:
What do you do when simulation software’s &amp; professionally built dynamometers themselves cost almost twice the seed investment raised? Well, you get an old electric moped from scrap and modify it to fit your core components and take it for a test ride, coz, hey, nothing can validate your design as well as the real site conditions. Need I say more, that’s exactly what we did.
