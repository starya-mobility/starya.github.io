#### March 2019:
Once the prototype was ready we were quite confident that within the next 3 months we would be ready and in all probability start shipping our units to all corners. Phew, ignorance is definitely truly blissful.

Below are the sequence of challenges (to sound optimistic) that were almost on repeat loop for the next 5 months.
 * Staring trouble-in layman turns the bike was stuck in 1 st gear
 * Hall sensor signal issues- the complete torque was not being utilized
 * Mosfet/Driver/Capacitors Blowing up
 * PID co-efficient setting issues
 * Belt wear due to improper alignment
 * The back wheel bending -again due to improper alignment
 * Ghastly mechanical noises—you guessed it-improper alignment!!
 * Well, it goes on & on…
