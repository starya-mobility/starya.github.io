## The Initial Brainstorms

###### May 2018:
After a preliminary research into the two wheeler EV segment, a lack of expertise in the powertrain &amp; BMS segment was evident. All players were importing the “heart” of an EV and assembling.

Although, life of the battery pack is not more than 4 to 5 years, the entire cost of the battery pack was being loaded upfront to the consumer. This was creating a big imbalance between the price &amp; performance vis-à-vis its IC engine counterpart.

As a case in point, the consumer would have to shell out almost double than what he would have paid for a 125 CC IC engine moped to get a similar performance.


## Evolution of specs

###### July 2018:
The decision was taken to develop the powertrain components, mainly the motor, controller &amp; mechanical reducers from scratch. The technical specification of the powertrain was frozen keeping the below three factors as the guiding rail.

 * Highest selling IC engine 2 wheeler moped in the country
 * It’s Price
 * Swappable subscription based Li ion battery packs

#### The outcome

To start the process of Design &amp; development of a 6.5 Kw Liquid cooled PMSM motor with a continuous torque of 30 Nm run by a F.O.C based 250 A sinusoidal controller that would accelerate a 108 Kg kerb weight vehicle from 0-40 in 3.5 S with a top speed of 75Km/Hr. The unit would be powered by a 2.1 Kwh swappable battery Pack giving a realistic mileage of around 73Km/Swap.
