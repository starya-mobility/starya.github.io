## Times, they are a changin! eureka & more

###### August 2019:
It had been almost 15 months since the first brainstorm and the EV market had rapidly changed since then, although a lack of expertise on the component level was still missing. The market was getting over crowded with almost a new EV player entering the market every fortnight. How do we re-align our business model to suit the changing times, how do we convert a disadvantage into an advantage? 
Well, why not convert our competitors into our customers while also having a parallel business vertical of our own. This is what led to the idea of a plug & play unit being born. It would cater to the below three main segments 
 * Convert existing IC engine 2 wheeler mopeds into electric
 * Supply the unit to EV manufacturers
 * Tie up with fleet management operators

## First Plug & play proto

###### December 2019:
After 4 months and sometime around December is when all the components of the core unit were received and ready to be assembled. This led to us having a glimpse of the first version of the plug & play unit ready to be assembled on to an IC engine bike.

## Controller - The Silent King Maker

###### December 2019:
Anyone with a little exposure into electronic speed controller design will tell you there is no middle ground here. It either works or burns! This would mean a 1000 different combinations need to be working perfectly every second of operation and any mistake does not slow or reduce the efficiency of the bike, it just halts it, period.

This is one of the reasons no one is willing to take the risk in getting it done themselves. Well, it neither made business or ethical sense for us to get it imported. We had to put all our learning to use and try to develop our own controller. The architecture and the Gerber files were ready; it was time to manufacture our own controller and the heat sink.
