#### December 2019:
Anyone with a little exposure into electronic speed controller design will tell you there is no middle ground here. It either works or burns! This would mean a 1000 different combinations need to be working perfectly every second of operation and any mistake does not slow or reduce the efficiency of the bike, it just halts it, period.

This is one of the reasons no one is willing to take the risk in getting it done themselves. Well, it neither made business or ethical sense for us to get it imported. We had to put all our learning to use and try to develop our own controller. The architecture and the Gerber files were ready; it was time to manufacture our own controller and the heat sink.
