#### October 2018:
It is always a surreal feeling to lay hands on the core building blocks of the core unit of the EV. It was almost after 4 months of design and simulation and development of dies and fixtures that the raw materials like the stator laminations/Magnets/motor body/motor shaft began to arrive one after the other ready to be assembled and tested. Any major change in system design was pretty much next to impossible at this point of time.

## Assembly & Testing of motor

#### January 2019:
Since the motor is at the heart of everything, it had to be assembled, tested and recorded with utmost precision and accuracy. Being a start-up this was a big challenge considering we did not have any of the high end capital equipment’s usually employed to perform such activities.

However, we were able to compromise for the high end machineries with our solid experience and pure skilled workmanship in motor manufacturing to ensure no compromise in quality of the product.

The other tricky aspect was to ensure no leakage of coolant from the coolant jacket housed inside the motor. The tolerances of both the water jacket and motor body had to be maintained at high precision to inhibit any leakage.

Finally the motor was tested on bench for 30 Nm using a simple rope &amp; pulley dynamometerfor main parameters like current/speed and temperature rise. It should be noted that it’svery important to know which exact parameter is to be tested that would give you a fairidea that your design is working, we were interested in establishing only that and nothingmore. It is easy to get carried away with very high end testing instruments and keepconducting tests only because the instrument can do so. Luckily for us all we had was arope/pulley/ammeter/tacho and an infrared gun so that we could only focus on whetherthe motor can carry the maximum load at its highest speed without heating up beyond itslimits for an hour when run continuously.

## First nearly working prototype

#### February 2019:
What do you do when simulation software’s &amp; professionally built dynamometers themselves cost almost twice the seed investment raised? Well, you get an old electric moped from scrap and modify it to fit your core components and take it for a test ride, coz, hey, nothing can validate your design as well as the real site conditions. Need I say more, that’s exactly what we did.
