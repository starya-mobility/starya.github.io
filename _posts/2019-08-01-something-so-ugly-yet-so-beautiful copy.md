## Something so ugly, yet so beautiful!!

###### July 2019:
After about 6 months of continuous setbacks, half a dozen burnt controllers,countless component changes, a couple of changed reduction pulleys &amp; belts, redesign ofback wheel housing, numerous iterations in tweaking parameter settings of the controllerand a final change in controller source design, on 23 rd July we were left with a bike (dare Icall it so) that made a terrible mechanical noise due to high misalignment, no front or sidepanel, no lights, brakes or horn. The total kerb weight of the bike was around 95Kgs (mainlydue to the 4 lead acid batteries in front) and boy, did it give us the most pleasant of allsurprises.
